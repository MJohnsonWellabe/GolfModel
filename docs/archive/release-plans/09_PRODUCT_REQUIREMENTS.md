- Skilled players find meaningful strategic depth.
- Graphics feel polished and modern.
- Progression encourages repeat play.
- Tournaments create friendly competition.
- The game performs reliably across supported devices.
- Players finish a round wanting to immediately play another.

---

# Final Acceptance Criteria

Before declaring Version 1.0 complete, ask the following questions:

- Does the game feel like a premium product?
- Does every shot require a meaningful decision?
- Is the presentation polished enough to impress a first-time player?
- Is every major system stable and complete?
- Would players recommend the game to a friend?
- Would the development team be proud to publicly release this version?

If the answer to any of these questions is "no," the game is not ready for Version 1.0.

---

# Final Product Statement

Johnson's Golf should be remembered not because it has the most features, but because every feature feels intentional, polished, and enjoyable.

The goal of Version 1.0 is to deliver a complete golf game that players can return to for years—not a prototype with endless ideas.

Ship quality.

Then expand.
